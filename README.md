## Description
The Network Packet Analyzer is a Python script that utilizes the Scapy library to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. This tool allows users to monitor IP traffic, view source and destination addresses, and inspect packet payloads. It provides an efficient way to inspect network communications and understand the data being transmitted.

## Features

- **Real-time Packet Capture:** Monitors and captures network packets as they are transmitted across the network.

- **IP Address Inspection:** Displays source and destination IP addresses of captured packets, providing insights into network traffic.

- **Payload Analysis:** Extracts and displays the payload of each packet, allowing users to see the data being transmitted.

- **Configurable Filtering:** Filters captured packets based on IP traffic, focusing on relevant data for analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy

### Install Dependencies
To install the required Python package, run:
```bash
$ pip install scapy
```

### Running the Script
To execute the script and start capturing network packets, run:
```bash
$ python app.py
```

The script will begin capturing IP packets and print details about each packet's source and destination addresses, protocol, and payload to the console.
